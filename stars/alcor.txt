Alcor is the fainter companion of Mizar, the two stars forming a naked eye double in the handle of the Big Dipper (or Plough) asterism in the constellation of Ursa Major. The two both lie about 83 light-years away from the Sun, as measured by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite.


== Nomenclature ==
Alcor has the Flamsteed designation 80 Ursae Majoris.  Alcor was originally Arabic سها‎ Suhā/Sohā, meaning either the ‘forgotten’ or ‘neglected’ one.; notable as a faintly perceptible companion of Mizar.In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Alcor for 80 UMa.


== Stellar system ==
With normal eyesight Alcor appears at about 12 minutes of arc from Mizar.  Alcor is of magnitude 3.99 and spectral class A5V. It has a faint red dwarf companion separated by 1 second of arc.Mizar and Alcor's proper motions show they move together, along with most of the other stars of the Big Dipper except Dubhe and Alkaid, as members of the Ursa Major Moving Group, a mostly dispersed group of stars sharing a common birth. However, it has yet to be demonstrated conclusively that they are gravitationally bound. Recent studies indicate that the Alcor binary and Mizar quadruple are somewhat closer together than previously thought: approximately 74,000 ± 39,000 AU or 0.5–1.5 light years. The uncertainty is due to our uncertainty about the exact distances from us. If they are exactly the same distance from us (somewhat unlikely) then the distance between them is only 17800 AU (0.281 ly).

		


== Other names ==
Alcor was known as Arundhati, wife of one of the Saptarishi, in traditional Indian astronomy.Al-Sahja was the rhythmical form of the usual Suhā/Sohā. It appears as الخوّار‎ al-Khawwar, 'the Faint One', Mizar is Chickadee and Alcor is his cooking pot in the Mi'kmaq myth of the great bear and the seven hunters.


=== Military namesakes ===
USS Alcor (AD-34) and USS Alcor (AK-259) are both United States Navy ships.
