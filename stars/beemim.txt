== Nomenclature ==
υ³ Eridani (Latinised to Upsilon³ Eridani) is the star's Bayer designation.
This star bore the traditional name Beemim (also Beemin, Theemim and Theemin). In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name Beemim for this star on 30 June 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.In Chinese, 天園 (Tiān Yuán), meaning Celestial Orchard, refers to an asterism consisting of Upsilon³ Eridani, Chi Eridani, Phi Eridani, Kappa Eridani, HD 16754, HD 23319, Theta Eridani, HD 24072, HD 24160, Upsilon⁴ Eridani, Upsilon² Eridani and Upsilon¹ Eridani. Consequently, Upsilon³ Eridani itself is known as 天園十一 (Tiān Yuán shíyī, English: the Eleventh Star of Celestial Orchard).
