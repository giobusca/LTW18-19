== Nomenclature ==
ω Sagittarii (Latinised to Omega Sagittarii) is the star's Bayer designation.
This star, together with 60, 62 and 59 Sagittarii, formed the asterism called Terebellum. According to a 1971 NASA memorandum, Terebellum was originally the title for four stars: Omega Sagittarii as Terebellum I, 59 Sagittarii as Terebellum II, 60 Sagittarii as Terebellum III and 62 Sagittarii as Terebellum IV . In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name Terebellum for Omega Sagittarii on 5 September 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.In Chinese, 狗國 (Gǒu Guó), meaning Dog Territory, refers to an asterism consisting of Omega Sagittarii, 60 Sagittarii, 62 Sagittarii and 59 Sagittarii. Consequently, Omega Sagittarii itself is known as 狗國一 (Gǒu Guó yī, English: the First Star of Dog Territory.)
