== Brief description ==
Lambda Scorpii (λ Scorpii, abbreviated Lambda Sco, λ Sco), also named Shaula, is (despite being designated 'Lambda') the second-brightest star system in the constellation of Scorpius, and one of the brightest stars in the nighttime sky.


== Nomenclature ==
λ Scorpii (Latinised to Lambda Scorpii) is the star's Bayer designation.
It bore the traditional name Shaula, which comes from the Arabic الشولاء  al-šawlā´ meaning 'the raised [tail]', as it is found in the tail of the scorpion (Scorpius). In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Shaula for this star.
In Chinese, 尾宿 (Wěi Xiù), meaning Tail, refers to an asterism consisting λ Scorpii, μ1 Scorpii, ε Scorpii, ζ1 Scorpii and ζ2 Scorpii, η Scorpii, θ Scorpii, ι1 Scorpii and ι2 Scorpii, κ Scorpii and υ Scorpii. Consequently, λ Scorpii itself is known as 尾宿八 (Wěi Xiù bā), "the Eighth Star of Tail".Together with Upsilon Scorpii (Lesath), Shaula is listed in the Babylonian compendium MUL.APIN as dSharur4 u dShargaz, meaning "Sharur and Shargaz".In Coptic, they were called Minamref.The indigenous Boorong people of northwestern Victoria (Australia) named it (together with Upsilon Scorpii) as Karik Karik, "the Falcons".


== Properties ==
Lambda Scorpii is located some 570 light-years away from the Sun.
Spectroscopic and interferometric observations have shown that it is actually a triple system consisting of two B-type stars and a pre-main-sequence star. The primary star is a beta Cephei variable star with rapid brightness changes of about a hundredth of a magnitude.  The pre-main-sequence star has an orbital period of 6 days and the B companion has a period of 1053 days.  The three stars lie in the same orbital plane, strongly suggesting that they were formed at the same time.  The masses of the primary, pre-main-sequence star and the B companion are 14.5, 2.0 and 10.6 solar masses, respectively. The age of the system is estimated to be in the range 10–13 million years.
A 15th-magnitude star has a separation of 42 arcseconds, whereas a 12th-magnitude star is 95 arcseconds away. It is not known whether or not these components are physically associated with Lambda Scorpii. If they both were, the first would have a projected linear separation of approximately 7,500 astronomical units (AU) and the second approximately 17,000 AU (0.27 light-years) away.


== In culture ==
Shaula appears on the flag of Brazil, symbolizing the state of Rio Grande do Norte.
USS Shaula (AK-118) was a U.S. Navy Crater-class cargo ship named after the star.
