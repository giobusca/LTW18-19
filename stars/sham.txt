== Brief description ==
Alpha Sagittae (α Sagittae, abbreviated Alpha Sge, α Sge), also named Sham, is a star in the constellation of Sagitta. Based upon parallax measurements taken during the Hipparcos mission, it is approximately 430 light-years from the Sun.

It bore the traditional name Sham (or Alsahm), which derives from the Arabic word سهم sahm, meaning "arrow", the name formerly having been applied to the whole constellation. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name Sham for this star on 12 September 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.In Chinese, 左旗 (Zuǒ Qí), meaning Left Flag, refers to an asterism consisting of Alpha Sagittae, Beta Sagittae, Delta Sagittae, Zeta Sagittae, Gamma Sagittae, 13 Sagittae, 11 Sagittae, 14 Sagittae and Rho Aquilae. Consequently, Alpha Sagittae itself is known as 左旗一 (Zuǒ Qí yī, English: the First Star of Left Flag).
