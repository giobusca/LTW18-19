The WGSN approved the name Albali for this star on 12 September 2016, and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.In the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, it was designated Nir Saad Bula (نير سعد ألبلع nayyir sa'd al bulaʽ), which was translated into Latin as Lucida Fortunæ Dissipantis, meaning "the brightest of luck of the swallower".In Chinese, 女宿 (Nǚ Sù), meaning Girl (asterism), refers to an asterism consisting of Epsilon Aquarii, Mu Aquarii, 4 Aquarii, 5 Aquarii and 3 Aquarii. Consequently, Epsilon Aquarii itself is known as 女宿一 (Nǚ Sù yī, English: the First Star of Girl).
