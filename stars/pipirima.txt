Mu² Scorpii (μ² Scorpii, abbreviated Mu² Sco, μ² Sco), also named Pipirima, is a star in the zodiac constellation of Scorpius. It has an apparent visual magnitude of +3.56, which is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. Its distance from the Sun is about 474 light-years, as determined by parallax measurements. It is a member of the Upper Centaurus-Lupus subgroup of the Scorpius–Centaurus Association.


== Nomenclature ==
μ² Scorpii (Latinised to Mu² Scorpii) is the star's Bayer designation.
It bore the traditional name Pipirima in Polynesian mythology. Especially in Tahitian myths, Pipirima is one of the 'Piri-ere-ua' (meaning 'The Inseparable Ones'), two children, a boy (named Pipirima) and a girl (named Réhua), who were fleeing their wicked parents and then became stars in the sky. According to other sources the boy's name is Pipiri and Pipiri-ma refers to 'Pipiri and his sister'. In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name Pipirima for this star on 5 September 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.In Chinese astronomy, Mu² Scorpii is called 尾宿增二.
