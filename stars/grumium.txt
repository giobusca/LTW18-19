== Brief description ==
Xi Draconis (ξ Draconis, abbreviated Xi Dra, ξ Dra) is a double or binary star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Draco. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.75. Based upon parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of 112.5 light-years (34.5 parsecs) from the Sun. At this distance, the apparent magnitude is diminished by 0.03 from extinction caused by intervening gas and dust.The two components are designated Xi Draconis A (also named Grumium) and B.


== Nomenclature ==
ξ Draconis (Latinised to Xi Draconis) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the two components as Xi Draconis A and B derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).It bore the traditional names Grumium or Genam. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Grumium for the component Xi Draconis A on 12 September 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.This star, along with Beta Draconis (Rastaban), Gamma Draconis (Eltanin), Mu Draconis (Erakis) and Nu Draconis (Kuma) were Al ʽAwāïd "the Mother Camels", which was later known as the Quinque Dromedarii.In Chinese, 天棓 (Tiān Bàng), meaning Celestial Flail, refers to an asterism consisting of Xi Draconis, Nu Draconis, Beta Draconis, Gamma Draconis and Iota Herculis. Consequently, Xi Draconis itself is known as 天棓一 (Tiān Bàng yī, English: the First Star of Celestial Flail).


=== Namesake ===
USS Grumium (AK-112) was a United States Navy Crater class cargo ship named after the star.


== Properties ==
Xi Draconis A is of spectral class K2-III. The possible companion, Xi Draconis B, is a 16th magnitude star 316 arcseconds away but, most likely, the pairing is just a line-of-sight coincidence.
