Andromeda is the 19th biggest constellation and was first listed about 2,000 years ago by Ptolemy, who was a Greco-Roman scientist. It can be viewed from both the Northern and Southern hemispheres but is actually located in the first quadrant of the Northern hemisphere at latitudes between +90° and -40°. This fascinating astronomical wonder is also part of the Perseus group of constellations which includes Cassiopeia and Pegasus.
In Greek mythology, Andromeda was the daughter of King Cepheus of Ethiopia and Queen Cassiopeia, who offended the Nereids (sea nymphs) by claiming she was more beautiful than they were. The nymphs complained to the sea god Poseidon and he sent a sea monster, Cetus, to flood and destroy Cepheus’ lands as punishment for his wife’s boastfulness. When the king sought advice from the Oracle of Ammon on how to prevent complete destruction of his lands, he was told that the only way to appease the gods and nymphs was to sacrifice his daughter to Cetus. Subsequently, Andromeda was chained to a rock and would have been left to the monster if Perseus had not come along and saved her. The two were later married and had six children, including Gorgophonte, who fathered Tyndareus, the famous Spartan king, and Perses, who was an ancestor of the Persians. In the story, it was the goddess Athena who commemorated the princess Andromeda by placing her image among the stars, next to the constellations representing her husband Perseus and mother Cassiopeia.
