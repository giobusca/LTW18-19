Andromeda is the 19th biggest constellation and was first listed about 2,000 years ago by Ptolemy, who was a Greco-Roman scientist. It can be viewed from both the Northern and Southern hemispheres but is actually located in the first quadrant of the Northern hemisphere at latitudes between +90° and -40°. This fascinating astronomical wonder is also part of the Perseus group of constellations which includes Cassiopeia and Pegasus.
