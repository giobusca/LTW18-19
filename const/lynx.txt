Lynx constellation is located in the northern hemisphere. It represents the lynx, and it is not usually associated with any myths.  Lynx is one of the several constellations that were introduced by the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius in the 17th century.  Hevelius created the constellation to fill a relatively large gap between the two neighboring constellations, Auriga and Ursa Major. He named it Lynx because it was pretty faint and it took the eyesight of a lynx to see it. Other than Alpha Lyncis, the constellation does not contain any stars brighter than fourth magnitude.
Hevelius named the constellation after the lynx because it is a relatively faint one. He wrote in his Prodromus astronomiae that only those who have the sight of a lynx can see it. The book is an unfinished work published by Hevelius’ wife around 1690, a few years after his death. In the accompanying star catalogue, Hevelius called the constellation “Lynx, sive Tigris” – Lynx or Tiger. While it is not known if Hevelius had any myths in mind when he named the constellation, there is a figure in mythology that might be linked to the constellation’s name. Lynceus, who sailed with Jason and the Argonauts, was said to have the keenest eyesight of all men and could even see things underground. He and his twin brother Idas were part of the expedition for the Golden Fleece. Some of the stars in Lynx were documented by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century, but only as “unformed” stars near Ursa Major, and not as part of any constellation.
