Octans constellation is located in the southern hemisphere. It was named after the octant, a navigational instrument.  The constellation was introduced by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century. Octans is the location of the South Celestial Pole. The constellation is circumpolar to the South Pole – it never sets below the horizon. It does not have any stars brighter than fourth magnitude or any deep sky objects that are bright enough for observers. Octans contains the southern pole star, Sigma Octantis, which is located about a degree away from the South Celestial Pole. The star cannot be used in navigation because it is too faint.
Octans was created by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1752. There are no myths associated with the constellation, in part because it is located too far south. Lacaille created it out of dim circumpolar stars and originally named it l’Octans de Reflexion, or “the reflecting octant,” which was the precursor to the modern sextant. The constellation was also known as Octans Hadleianus, after John Hadley, the English mathematician who invented the octant in 1730. When he created the constellation, Lacaille moved several stars from the neighbouring constellation Hydrus.
