Microscopium constellation lies in the southern hemisphere. It represents the microscope and is not associated with any myths.  Microscopium lies to the south of Capricornus, between the constellations Piscis Austrinus and Sagittarius. It is a small, faint constellation that is hard to see from northern latitudes. It was introduced by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century.  The brightest stars in Microscopium are only of fifth magnitude and the constellation cannot be seen without binoculars in less than ideal observing conditions. It does not have any bright deep sky objects.
Microscopium constellation was created by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1751-1752. Lacaille named it after an early type of compound microscope, one that used more than one lens and was widely used in the 18th century. He described the constellation as depicting “a tube above a square box.” The official boundaries of the constellation as it is today were set by the Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930.
