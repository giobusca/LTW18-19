Dorado constellation lies in the southern hemisphere. Its name means “the dolphinfish” (Coryphaena hippurus) in Spanish. Dorado constellation was created by the Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius from the observations of Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. The constellation was first depicted in Johann Bayer’s star atlas Uranometria in 1603. Dorado contains most of the Large Magellanic Cloud, an irregular galaxy near the Milky Way. The South Ecliptic Pole is also located in the direction of this constellation.
There are no myths associated with the constellation. Dorado was one of the 12 constellations created by the Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius, who mostly named the newly created southern constellations after animals. Dorado has also sometimes been referred to as the Swordfish constellation, or Xipias.
