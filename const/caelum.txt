Caelum is the eighth smallest constellation in the sky, occupying only 125 square degrees. It is located in the first quadrant of the Southern hemisphere and can be viewed specifically at latitudes between +40° and -90°. The crooked line of Caelum represents “the chisel” and derives its name from the Latin language.
There are no myths associated with Caelum. It is one of the constellations introduced by the French astronomer Lacaille in the 18th century. Lacaille named his constellations after various instruments and tools, not stories and myths. Caelum is depicted as a sculptor’s chisel. It first appeared in Lacaille’s map of the southern stars published in 1756, as “les Burins,” a pair of crossed burins connected by a ribbon. (Burins are sharp engraving tools.) In Johann Bode’s star atlas Uranographia, the constellation still had the longer name, Caela Scalptoris.
