Corona Australis is a small, faint constellation in the southern sky. Its name means “the southern crown” in Latin. It is located between the constellations Sagittarius and Scorpius. Corona Australis is said to represent the crown worn by the centaur represented by Sagittarius by some sources, but the constellation is not really tied to any particular myth. Sometimes it is also called Corona Austrina. Corona Australis was first catalogued by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century, along with the constellation representing the northern crown, Corona Borealis.
Corona Australis, the Southern Crown, was known by the Greeks as a wreath, not a crown. Before Ptolemy introduced its stars as a separate constellation, Corona Australis was known as a circlet of stars near the forefeet of the centaur represented by the neighbouring constellation Sagittarius. The constellation is sometimes associated with the myth of Dionysus. In the story, Corona Australis represents the crown the god placed in the sky after freeing his mother Semele from the god of the underworld, Hades. This particular myth, however, is also sometimes associated with the Northern Crown, Corona Borealis. Ptolemy originally assigned 13 stars to the constellation Corona Australis, but one of them was later moved to the constellation Telescopium, where it became Alpha Telescopii.
