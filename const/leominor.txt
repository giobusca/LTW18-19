Leo Minor is a small, faint constellation in the northern sky, with only one star brighter than fourth magnitude.  The constellation’s name means “the smaller lion” in Latin. Leo Minor was created by the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius in 1687. Hevelius created the constellation from 18 stars between the larger constellations Leo and Ursa Major.  Leo Minor is located between Ursa Major to the north, Cancer to the southwest, Lynx to the west, and Leo, which represents the larger lion, to the south. Notable deep sky objects in Leo Minor include Hanny’s Voorwerp, a quasar ionization echo, and the interacting galaxies Arp 107. 
Leo Minor is a relatively new constellation, and has no myths associated with it. It was first depicted in 1687 in Johannes Hevelius’ Catalogus Stellarum Fixarum. In 1845, the catalogue was revised by Francis Baily, who assigned Greek letters to stars that were brighter than magnitude 4.5, but he did not give the constellation’s brightest star the designation Alpha in his British Association Catalogue.  In 1870, the English astronomer Richard A. Proctor renamed the constellation to Leaena, or the Lioness, in an attempt to shorten constellation names in order to make them easier to manage on star charts, but the name was not widely adopted.
