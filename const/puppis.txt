Puppis constellation is located in the southern hemisphere. It represents the stern of a ship.  Puppis used to be part of the much larger constellation Argo Navis, which represented the ship on which Jason and the Argonauts sailed to get the Golden Fleece, before the constellation was divided into several smaller ones: Carina (the keel), Vela (the sails) and Puppis (the stern).  Argo Navis was first catalogued by the astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century. It was divided into the smaller constellations by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1752.  Puppis is a relatively large constellation which contains many notable deep sky features, including three Messier objects – the open clusters M46, M47 and M93 – and the planetary nebulae NGC 2438, NGC 2440 and NGC 2467 (the Skull and Crossbones Nebula).
Puppis is one of the three constellations that used to form the Greek constellation Argo Navis, which represented the ship on which Jason and the Argonauts sailed to get the Golden Fleece. The French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille divided the Argo Navis constellation into the three smaller ones – Carina, Puppis and Vela – in the 18th century. Puppis is the largest of the three. Neither Puppis nor Vela have stars designated Alpha and Beta, as these stars were allocated to Carina constellation.
