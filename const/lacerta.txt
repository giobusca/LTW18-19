Lacerta constellation lies in the northern sky, between Andromeda and Cygnus. Its name means “the lizard” in Latin. Lacerta was created by the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius in 1687. It is a small, faint constellation that is sometimes referred to as Little Cassiopeia because its brightest stars form a “W” shape, just like the stars in the considerably larger Cassiopeia constellation. The brightest stars in Lacerta are only of fourth magnitude and none of them have proper names. There are no myths associated with the constellation. 
The name Lacerta does not come from mythology. Johannes Hevelius introduced the constellation in Firmamentum Sobiescianum, his star atlas published in 1690.  He gave the constellation an alternative name, Stellio, after a type of lizard known as a starred agama, but this name was not used much and soon fell into oblivion.
