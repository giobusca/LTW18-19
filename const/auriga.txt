Auriga is the 21st biggest constellation in size and covers 657 square degrees. It can be viewed in the first quadrant of the Northern hemisphere and lies specifically at latitudes between +90° and -40°. Like some of the other constellations, in the 2nd century Auriga was first catalogued by Ptolemy, who was a Greek astronomer.

Capella (Alpha Aurigae) is the brightest star in Auriga (which will be discussed later in detail).
