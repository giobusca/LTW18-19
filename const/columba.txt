Columba constellation is located in the southern sky. Its name means “the dove” in Latin. The constellation’s original name was Columba Noachi, meaning “Noah’s dove,” after the biblical dove that informed Noah that the Great Flood was receding. Columba was introduced by the Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius in the late 16th century and it later appeared in Johann Bayer’s star atlas Uranometria of 1603. The constellation contains the famous runaway star Mu Columbae, the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1808 and the globular cluster NGC 1851, among other objects.
Columba represents Noah’s dove in the sky. Petrus Plancius created the constellation from the stars located behind Argo Navis, the constellation that represented the Argonauts’ ship and was later split into several smaller constellations. Plancius later renamed Argo Navis to “Noah’s Ark” on a celestial globe of 1613. In the myth, Noah’s dove is sent from the Ark to see if there is any dry land left after the Great Flood. The bird returns holding an olive branch in its beak, signalling that the flood is receding. In some interpretations, Columba represents the dove sent by the Argonauts between the Clashing Rocks to ensure the Argonauts’ safe passage.
