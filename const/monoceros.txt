Monoceros constellation lies in the northern sky, on the celestial equator. Its name means “the unicorn” in Latin.  Monoceros was introduced by the Dutch astronomer and cartographer Petrus Plancius from the observations of Dutch navigators in the 17th century. The constellation represents the mythical single-horned, horse-like creature. Monoceros is a relatively faint constellation, containing only a few fourth magnitude stars, but it is nevertheless home to several notable stars: the famous variables S Monocerotis, R Monocerotis, and V838 Monocerotis, Plaskett’s Star, which is one of the most massive binary stars known, and the triple star Beta Monocerotis.
Monoceros first appeared on a globe by the Dutch cartographer and clergyman Petrus Plancius in 1612 as Monoceros Unicornis. The constellation was created to fill the area between two large constellations, Orion and Hydra, where there weren’t any constellations introduced in Greek times. Plancius introduced the unicorn figure because the mythical animal appears several times in the Old Testament of the Bible. The constellation is not associated with any particular myth. The German astronomer Jakob Bartsch included the constellation in his 1624 star chart as Unicornus.
