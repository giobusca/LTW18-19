Sculptor constellation lies in the southern sky, to the south of Aquarius and Cetus.  It was one of the southern constellations introduced by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century. Lacaille originally named it Apparatus Sculptoris, which means “the sculptor’s studio,” but the name was later shortened to Sculptor.  Sculptor is a rather faint constellation, with no stars brighter than third magnitude. It contains the south galactic pole and is home to several interesting deep sky objects, including the Cartwheel Galaxy, the Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253), and the Sculptor Dwarf.
Sculptor constellation is not associated with any myths. It is one of the southern constellations introduced by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1751-1752. On his planisphere of 1756, Lacaille named the constellation l’Atelier du Sculpteur, which is French for “the sculptor’s studio.” The constellation was depicted as a carved head lying on a tripod table, next to a sculptor’s mallet and two chisels. The name was Latinized to Apparatus Sculptoris on Lacaille’s 1763 planisphere and in 1844 the English astronomer John Herschel proposed shortening the name to Sculptor. His suggestion was adopted by Francis Baily in his British Association Catalogue of 1845, and the constellation has been known as Sculptor ever since.
