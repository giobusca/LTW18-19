Bootes is the 13th biggest constellation in size and covers 907 square degrees. It can be viewed in the third quadrant of the Northern hemisphere and lies specifically at latitudes between +90° and -50°. To correctly say, Bootes, each “o” is pronounced separately, putting emphasis on the “tes.”
main stars
Arcturus (Alpha Boötis) is the brightest star in this constellation, which will be discussed later in detail.
Nekkar (Beta Boötis) is also known as “Meress” and is a yellow G-type giant. Nekkar is also a “flare star” which means it will show shines of brilliant luminosity for brief periods of time.
Seginus (Gamma Boötis) is considered a Delta Scuti type variable star, because it has degrees of luminosity due to radial and non-radial surface pulsations.
Izar (Pulcherrima) ~ (Epsilon Boötis) is sometimes known as, Pulcherrima, which means “loveliness” in Latin. This star is binary in nature consisting of a bright orange giant and a fainter main sequence star.
Muphrid (Saak) ~ (Eta Boötis) this star’s name originates from the Arabic phrase meaning, “the single one of the lancer.” It is close to Arcturus and is catalogued as a spectroscopic binary star.
Alkalurops ~ (Mu Boötis) is derived from the Greek language (kalaurops) which means “the shepherd’s staff.” It is a triple star made up of a bright yellow-white F-type subgiant and a fainter binary star.
Merga (38 Boötis) is located 153 light-years away and its name is derived from the Arabic pharse which means “the chained woman.” It is also catalogued as a spectral class F7IVw.
Nadlat (Psi Boötis) is an orange K-type giant that is located about 250 light-years from Earth.
Tau Boötis is binary in nature; yellow-white dwarf and a dim red giant. The main star was discovered (in 1996) to have an extrasolar planet in its orbit.
