Circinus constellation is located in the southern sky. Its name means “the compass” in Latin, referring to the tool for drawing circles. Circinus was created and first catalogued by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century. Lacaille created the constellation to bridge the void between Triangulum Australe and the stars marking Centaurus‘s forefeet. Circinus contains several notable deep sky objects, including the Circinus Galaxy, the X-ray source Circinus X-1, the pulsar PSR B1509-58, the open clusters NGC 5823 and NGC 5715, and the planetary nebula NGC 5315.
There are no myths associated with Circinus. The constellation was named after the drafting tool used for drawing circles (not after a mariner’s compass, which is represented by the constellation Pyxis). It is depicted as a pair of dividing compasses used by draughtsmen to measure distances. Lacaille originally named the constellation le Compas and placed it next to Triangulum Australe, which he depicted as a surveyor’s level, to fill the void between several existing constellations in the south.
