main stars
Sirius (Alpha Canis Majoris) shines the brightest in the Canis Major constellation (which will be discussed later in detail).
Adhara (Epsilon Canis Majoris) is the second brightest star in this constellation and also the 24th brightest in the night sky. This binary star gets its name from the Arabic language meaning “virgins.”
Wezen (Delta Canis Majoris) is a F-type supergiant that shines the third brightest in Canis Major. It is around 10 million years-old and will eventually turn into a red supergiant then go supernova.
Murzim (Beta Canis Majoris) has a surface that pulsates, therefore it varies in brightness. It is classified as a blue-white giant.
Aludra (Eta Canis Majoris) is approaching the end of its life and is expected to go supernova in the next few million years.
Tau Canis Majoris is located 3,200 light-years from Earth and is catalogued as an eclipsing spectroscopic binary star.
Phurud (Zeta Canis Majoris) is a spectroscopic binary star that consists of a blue-white B-type main sequence dwarf and a star that is unseen.
