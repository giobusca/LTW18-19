Horologium constellation lies in the southern sky. Its name means “the clock” in Latin. It is a small, faint constellation that was created in the 18th century by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. Lacaille originally named the constellation Horologium Oscillitorium, or “the pendulum clock,” but the name was later shortened to simply Horologium, “the clock.” The constellation is not associated with any myths and does not have any bright stars. It is home to the Horologium Supercluster, a massive supercluster containing about 5,000 galaxy groups.
Lacaille named the constellation after the pendulum clock to honour its inventor Christiaan Huygens. The constellation represents the pendulum clock Lacaille used to time his observations. The brightest star in the constellation, Alpha Horologii, represents the pendulum in some depictions, and is located on one of the weights in others.
