Camelopardalis is the 18th largest constellation covering 757 square degrees in the second quadrant of the Northern hemisphere. It can be viewed specifically at latitudes between +90° and -10°. Camelopardalis represents the giraffe, which was once known as a camel-leopard (it has a long neck like a camel and the spots of a leopard). For this reason it actually gets its name from the Latin derivative of the Greek word for giraffe; camel (Greek kamēlos) and leopard (pardalis).
The constellation is pretty faint, with no stars brighter than fourth magnitude. The Greeks did not see any stars in Camelopardalis and thought this region of the sky, as well as what is now the constellation Lynx, was empty. There are no myths associated with the constellation as it was only created in the 17th century. While the giraffe is not a reference to mythology, the constellation’s name could be a reference to the book of Genesis in the Bible, but this remains doubtful. When Jacob Bartsch included Camelopardalis on his star map of 1624, he described the constellation as a camel on which Rebecca rode into Canaan, where she was to marry Isaac. Since Camelopardalis represents a giraffe and not a camel, this explanation does not seem likely.
