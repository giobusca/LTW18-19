Lupus constellation lies in the southern hemisphere, between Centaurus and Scorpius. Its name means “the wolf” in Latin.  Lupus was first catalogued by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century. Even though it is an old constellation, Lupus is not associated with any myths.  The constellation is home to several interesting stars and deep sky objects. These include the historic supernova remnant SN 1006, the globular clusters NGC 5824 and NGC 5986, and the Retina Nebula (IC 4406).
The stars that now form the constellation Lupus used to be part of Centaurus constellation. They represented a sacrificed animal impaled by the centaur. The centaur was holding it toward the constellation Ara, the altar. The constellation was not associated with any animal in particular until the Renaissance times, when the Latin translation of Ptolemy’s work identified it with the wolf. The Greeks knew the constellation as Therium, a wild animal, and the Romans called it Bestia, the beast. In Greek times, the constellation was probably taken to represent a creature based on the Babylonian figure of the Mad Dog. The creature was a hybrid, with a human head and torso and legs and tail of a lion. The creature was frequently associated with the sun god and Bison-man, which is another creature from myth, and it was called UR.IDIM, with UR referring to a large carnivore, which could have been a lion, wolf, or a dog.
