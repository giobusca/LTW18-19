Sextans constellation lies in the southern sky, near the celestial equator. It represents the astronomical sextant.  Sextans is located in a dim region of the sky between the constellations Hydra, Crater, and Leo. The constellation was created by the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius in the 17th century. It is a rather faint one, with only one star brighter than fifth magnitude.  Sextans contains several notable deep sky objects, among them the Spindle Galaxy (NGC 3115), the spiral galaxies NGC 3166 and NGC 3169, and the irregular galaxies Sextans A and Sextans B. It is also home to the most distant known galaxy cluster, CL J1001+0220, and the Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy, which contains stars formed soon after the Big Bang.
Sextans constellation is not associated with any myths. It was introduced by the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius in 1687. He originally named the constellation Sextans Uraniae after the instrument he had used to measure star positions until it was destroyed in a fire at his observatory in 1679. Even though telescopes were available to him, Hevelius preferred to use the sextant for naked-eye sightings, and continued to do so throughout his life.
